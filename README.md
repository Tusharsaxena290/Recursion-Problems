### What is Recursion?
</br>
</br>
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

### All recursive algorithms must obey three **IMPORTANT** laws:
</br>
</br>

- A **RECURSIVE** algorithm must call itself, **RECURSIVELY**.

</br>

- A **RECURSIVE** algorithm must have a base case.

</br>

- A **RECURSIVE** algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
